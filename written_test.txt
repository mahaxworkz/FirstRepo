	1.Explain about Condtructor & its types?
             CONSTRUCTOR:
                * Constructor is a Special Method which is used to create and initializing an objects.
                * In the class ,it always contain one default constructor.
             Rules :
                 1. The class name and the constructor name must be same.
                 2. There is no explicit return type in constructor.				 
				 3. Constructor doesn't contain static,final,keywords etc.
			Syntax;
			   public class classname{
			   
			       public classname(){
				   //block of constructor
				   }
			   }
			   
			Types of constructor:
                 1)Default Condtructor or no arg constructor:
				        In default constructor It does't contain any parameters.It defaultly assign values like 0 or null based on the datatype.    
					Syntax
					     public class classname{
			   
			       public classname(){
				   //block of constructor
				   }
			       }
			      2) Parameterized Condtructor:
				         In parameterized constructor it contains parameters.It declared the variables within the parantheses.
						Syntax:
					     public class classname{
			   
			       public classname(datatype refername){
				   //block of constructor
				   }
			       } 
				   for example 
				    
					     public class Animal{
			   
			       public Animal(String name){
				   //block of constructor
				   }
			       }
				   Call the Constructor:
				       Call the constructor using  new() keyword.
					   example Animal  animal = new Animal("lion");

		2)FEATURES OF JAVA ;
               Java have more features like,
			   
			   1. Object oriented    2. Simple   3.multithread    4.Portable  5.dynamic   6.Distributed 
			   7.security     8.interpreted   9.high performance 10.neutral technology   11.platform independent
			   
			   
			   1.Simple:
			        * Java is easy to learn compared to the other programming language.
					* It easy to understand by beginner level of programmers.
					 
			   2. Object oriented :
 			        * Java is an object oriented language.Other languages like c,c++ are procedure oriented languages.
					* Object oriented means the objects are communicates through the program.
					* objects are instance of class .The class is collection of objects or blueprint of Objects.
			   3.Multithread:
			        * Java is a multithreaded language .Because It can access more than one objects at a time.
			   4. platform independent:
                    * java has a concept like WORA(Write once run anywhere)	
					* Compiler compiles the Java coding into Byte code. This Byte code run any platform ,but the platform must have jvm.
					* It runs all os like windows ,linux etc.
					
				---------*------------
		3) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN C++ &  JAVA		
		
		
		              JAVA                                                    C++
				
				* java is a platform independent                    * C++ is a platform dependent language.
				  language.
				  
				* In java there is no copy constructor.             * here it contain copy Condtructor.
				
				* In java ,pointor is not used because of data      * Here c++ use pointors
				   safty
					  
				* java is a dynamic language.                       * c++ is standard language.
					  
				* java 	is a multi thread ,                         * C++ behaves based on the operating system and technologies
				    neutral  in technology also 
				* object oriented	                                * procedure oriented
					  
				 ---------------*------------  
					  
		4) JDK ,JVM,JRE		


		    JDK:
			  
			  * JDK is abbrivated as JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 
			  * Jdk is an whole pakage kit used to create and run the softwares.
			  * jdk contains JRE (JRE contains JVM) ,library files and jit compiler.
			  
			JRE:
			 * JRE is abbrivatedas JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT .
			 * JRE cintains JVM itself.
			 * JRE  is ane environment to run the java applications,programs.
			 *It includes library files also.
			  
			JVM:
			*Jvm is abbrivated as JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE.
			* Jvm is an abstract machine ie.it is a virtual machine .
			* There is no hardware components presented.
			* JVM is checks the class file contain main method.If it presents it load the class and allocate the memory .
			  
			 ---------**_______ 
			  
			  
		5) TYPES OF MEMORY  AREA  ALLOCATED BY JVM	
		
			  TYPES OF MEMORY 
			         1.STACK MEMORY
					 2. HEAP MEMORY
					 
			  STACK MEMORY:
			  * Class loader loads the class.Jvm checks the main method.
			  * IF main methodis presented then it create a stack and stack frame.
			  * The methods are include three parts.They are
			         1. method name
					 2. variables 
					 3.  execution line
					 
		      * if the method have other methods create a othe stack frame.
			  * The methods are executed correctly then the stack frame will be deleted.
			  * After all methods execution the overall stack will be deleted.
			  
			  HEAP MEMORY:
			   * The STRING data are stored in the heap memory.
			   * The heap divided into two parts They are
			           1. constant pool or String pool
			           2. instance pool
     
			    1. Constant pool 
				      *the strings which are created by literal  stored here.
					 * IF the string is already exist it donot store the same string .It referenced the same address
				2. instance pool:
				     * In instance pool the strings which are created using new() keywords. 
			         * Here each string is an objects .
					 
			  ----------*---------
			  
		6)   METHODS 	
               
			   DEFINITION:
			       Methods are a functions that consist of block of statements.The methods ate callad in the main method the
				   function and the block of statements will be  executed.
				   
				Syntax:
                    ACCESS SPECIFIER   NONACCESSSPECIFIER  RETURNTYPE  METHOD NAME(PARAMETERS)	{
					
					//////bliack of statements
					
					}			
					
				example:
                    public static void methodone(){
					   System.out.println("hi");
					}				
			  
			  * ACCESS SPECIFIER:
			         this indicates  to the class who can access the  particular method.
			  
			  * NON ACCESS SPECIFIER
			         Its indicate  there is no access specified for the method.
					 generall static is used
			  
			  * RETURN TYPES
			        It shows which return type we used.
					void means there is no return type.
					The return type and the rteurn values must be same data type.
			  
			  * Methodname
					it indicates the name of the methods  
					  
			  * parameters 
			      here the parameters are written inside the parantheses

		7)    METHOD OVERLOADING
		
		         Method overloading means the meathods have same methods name but different in parameters.
				 
				 Types of method overloading 
				 1.number of parameters
				 2.order of data types
				 3. data types
				 
			1) NUMBER OF PARAMETERS 
                 
				 * the method name are same but difference in parameters.
				 
				example:

				   public class Overloading{
				   
				       public static void main(string[] args){
					   
					     Overload();
						 Overload(4);
						 Overload(4,6);
						 Overload(4,68,67); 
					   
					   }
                  public static void Overload(){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(int num){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(int value ,int num1){
	                      System.out.println("oops");
	   
	                    } public static void Overload(int value1,int val2,int val3){
	                      System.out.println("object");
	   
	                    }
				   
				   }
				 
				2)different data types ;
				 
				 * the method name are same but difference in data types.
				 
				example:

				   public class Overloading{
				   
				       public static void main(string[] args){
					   
					     Overload();
						 Overload(4);
						 Overload(4,6f);
						  
					   
					   }
                  public static void Overload(){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(int num){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(int value ,float num1){
	                      System.out.println("oops");
	   
	                    } 
				   
				   }
				 
				 
				3)  order of parameters  
				
				* the method name are same but difference in order of parameters.
				 
				example:

				   public class Overloading{
				   
				       public static void main(string[] args){
					   
					     Overload(6f,4,"fuji");
						 Overload(4,6f,"fuji");
						 Overload("fuji",4,6f);
						   
					   
					   }
                  public static void Overload(float val1 ,int num,String name){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(int num,float val1,String name){
	                      System.out.println("java");
	   
	                    }
						 public static void Overload(String name ,int num,float val1){
	                      System.out.println("oops");
	   
	                    } public static void Overload(int value1,int val2,int val3){
	                      System.out.println("object");
	   
	                    }
				   
				   }

		8)   CONSTRUCTOR VS METHOD 		 
				 
				 
				 CONSTRUCTOR                                                         METHOD 
				 
				 
		    * it is a special method to create and initializing           * it is a collection of function .the function contains the specific task
			   an objects.
				 
			* the class name and constructor name must be same            * the method name is different	 
				 
			* there is no return type                                      * the return type is presented . 	 
				 
			* here no final,static keywords are used                       * in method is used static keywords
				 
				 
				 
			--------------------*----------

      10) CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING
	  
	  
	       DEFINITION  
		       In constructor overloading ,the constructor name must be same but different in parameters 


           Example 
		   
		      public class Animal{
			  
			  public Animal(){
			  
			     System.out.println("hi");
			  }
			  public Animal(int num){
			  
			     System.out.println("hi");
			  }
			  public Animal(String name){
			  
			     System.out.println("hi");
			  }
			  
			  public static void main(String[] args){
			  
			  Animal animal =new Animal();
			  Animal animal =new Animal(8);
			  Animal animal =new Animal("fuji");
			  
			  }	  
			  
			  
			  }


    9)   STATIC VARIABLES ;
	      
		  * Static variables are accessed any where in side the class. dont want to create a objects 

		  
		  
		  syntax:
		     Static datatype refname = value;//initializing
			 
			 Static datatype refname;
			 
			 example:
			    Static int value;
				Static int value= 10;//initializing


         STATIC METHODS
		 
		     the methods are called directly by its class name.
			 dont want to create a objects

          syntax:
		    public  static  void method01(){
			
			
			}
			  
		STATIC BLOCKS 
                it is used to  declare , initialize the static variables .
				it execute before the main methods.
				
			syntax:
		    static {
			
			//// static variables
			}
